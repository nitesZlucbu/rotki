Apo Hiking Society started as a group of 15 students from Ateneo de Manila High School in 1969. They named themselves after Apolinario Mabini, a Philippine revolutionary hero who was also a hiker. The group was composed of John Paul Micayabas, Lito de Joya, Sonny Santiago, Gus Cosio, Renato Garcia, Chito Kintanar, Kenny Barton, Bruce Brown, Butch Dans, Kinjo Sawada, Ric Segreto Macaraeg, Goff Macaraeg, Doden Besa, Jim Paredes and Boboy Garrovillo. Danny Javier joined them later in college. [^1^]
 
The group first gained recognition in 1973 when they gave a farewell concert at the Meralco Theater in Pasig City, Metro Manila, Philippines. Just out of college, the group was the talk of the Ateneo University and adjoining campuses for their music and humor. It was only when two of its members were about to retire from the field of amateur music that the APO decided to pursue a professional career. One of them was scheduled to leave for Turkey as an exchange student. The other had a position waiting for him in his father's advertising firm. However, the trip to Turkey did not materialize and the APO became a trio of Danny Javier, Jim Paredes and Boboy Garrovillo. [^2^] [^3^]
 
The trio adopted the name APO Hiking Society as a tribute to their original group and as a pun on the Tagalog word "apo" which means grandchild or wise man. They also became one of the pioneers and icons of Original Pilipino Music (OPM), a term coined by Danny Javier to refer to Filipino pop songs that are not influenced by foreign music. They wrote and performed songs that reflected Filipino culture, values, sentiments and humor. They also experimented with different musical genres and styles, such as folk rock, ballad, reggae, disco and new wave. [^1^] [^2^]
